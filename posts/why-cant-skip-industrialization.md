**EN**  
The idea that developing countries can bypass manufacturing and leapfrog straight to services has become more fashionable. Services are becoming a more important source of economic growth and commercial activity, and many question whether traditional industrialization still matters — or is even possible. India’s business process outsourcing boom, UAEs success with financial services, and the Phillippines’s call centre surge are all held up as proof that countries can potentially skip factory-based production.

**中**  
“发展中国家可以绕过制造业，直接跃迁到服务业”的观点越来越流行。服务业确实正在成为经济增长与商业活动中更重要的来源，于是很多人开始质疑：传统意义上的工业化是否仍然重要——甚至是否还可能实现。印度的业务流程外包繁荣、阿联酋在金融服务上的成功、以及菲律宾呼叫中心的增长，都常被当作证据：国家也许可以跳过工厂式生产。

---

**EN**  
We should acknowledge new service-based development opportunities. But the notion that countries can skip industrialization is mostly wishful thinking. The evidence shows that very few countries have developed without a strong, competitive manufacturing base. The reason is that services cannot replace what manufacturing uniquely provides: sustained productivity growth, innovation, trade, and the foundation for a strong economy.

**中**  
我们应该承认：确实出现了新的“服务业驱动发展”的机会。但“国家可以跳过工业化”的想法，多半是一厢情愿。证据表明：极少有国家能在缺少强大且有竞争力的制造业基础的情况下实现发展。原因在于，服务业无法替代制造业所独有地提供的东西：持续的生产率增长、创新、贸易能力，以及强健经济的底座。

**EN**  
Virtually every country that has successfully transformed from poor to rich has done so through industrialization. Between 1750 and 1950, the West’s establishment as the world’s economic hegemon was fundamentally a process of becoming the world’s manufacturing hegemon. Since 1950, this pattern has persisted with remarkable consistency. A World Bank study published in 2008 identified 13 countries that sustained annual growth rates of 7% or higher for a period of 25 years or longer. Among these growth miracles, only two — Botswana and Oman, both small countries with highly idiosyncratic economic structures — achieved this without manufacturing-led development. Every other country on that list built its prosperity by expanding manufacturing capabilities.

**中**  
几乎所有成功实现“从穷到富”转型的国家，都是通过工业化完成的。1750 到 1950 年间，西方确立其全球经济霸权，本质上是其成为“全球制造业霸权”的过程。1950 年之后，这一模式仍以惊人的一致性持续存在。世界银行 2008 年发表的一项研究识别出 13 个国家：它们将年均增长率维持在 7% 或更高，并持续 25 年或更长。在这些“增长奇迹”中，只有两个国家——博茨瓦纳与阿曼（都是经济结构非常特殊的小国）——不是通过“制造业引领的发展”实现的。名单上的其他国家，都是通过扩张制造业能力来积累繁荣。

**EN**  
More recent data by the UN Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) arrive at similar conclusions. In their Industrial Development Report 2026, they highlight that 64% of growth episodes over the last 50 years can be directly attributed to manufacturing. Specific case-study evidence strengthens this hypothesis. The two most successful economic development stories of recent times as measured by sustained economic growth, China and Vietnam, achieved rapid growth through export-led industrialization. Both countries are currently two of the world’s strongest manufacturing economies (China, unquestionably, being the strongest).

**中**  
联合国工业发展组织（UNIDO）的更近期数据也得出类似结论。在《工业发展报告 2026》中，他们强调：过去 50 年的增长阶段中，有 64% 可以直接归因于制造业。更具体的案例也强化了这一判断。以持续经济增长衡量，近些年来最成功的两个发展故事——中国与越南——都通过“出口导向的工业化”实现了快速增长。两国目前也都是全球最强的制造业经济体之一（中国无疑是最强的那个）。

---

**EN**  
In fact, the full historical record shows that no country except a few natural-resource rich states (mostly oil-dependent) or tiny financial havens has achieved high living standards without developing a competitive manufacturing sector. This is why “industrialized country” and “developed country” are used interchangeably.

**中**  
事实上，完整的历史记录显示：除少数自然资源极其丰富的国家（多为石油依赖型）或极小的金融避风港之外，没有国家能在不发展出有竞争力的制造业部门的情况下达到高生活水平。这也是为什么“工业化国家”和“发达国家”常常被当作同义词使用。

---

**EN**  
The flip side tells the same story. Regions that have experienced premature de-industrialization have suffered growth slowdowns. Latin America, which went through severe de-industrialization in the 1980s and 1990s, saw manufacturing’s declining share of GDP coincide with decelerated growth. In Africa, premature de-industrialization caused negative economic growth in the same time period. Even OECD countries have experienced growth slowdowns alongside deindustrialization in the past few decades.

**中**  
反过来看，故事同样成立：经历“过早去工业化”的地区往往会遭遇增长放缓。拉丁美洲在 1980、1990 年代经历严重去工业化，制造业在 GDP 中占比下降与增长减速同时发生。非洲在同一时期的过早去工业化甚至导致负增长。甚至在过去几十年里，经合组织（OECD）国家也在去工业化的同时出现增长放缓。

**EN**  
The new appeal of services is understandable, and we shouldn’t discount them. Many digital services do indeed provide some innovation and development. Megacities in India, such as Bangalore and Hyderabad, are prime examples. But when we examine what fundamentally drives productivity growth and innovation, manufacturing retains fundamental advantages that services struggle to match.

**中**  
服务业之所以重新受到追捧是可以理解的，我们也不应低估它。许多数字服务确实带来创新与发展；印度的班加罗尔、海得拉巴等超级城市就是典型例子。但当我们追问“生产率增长与创新到底由什么驱动”时，制造业仍然拥有服务业难以匹敌的根本优势。

---

**EN**  
Manufacturing activities lend themselves more easily to mechanization and chemical processing. This, combined with the ease of spatially concentrating manufacturing production, enhances the potential of productivity growth through economies of scale — both static based on output level and dynamic through learning-by-doing effects. These advantages are difficult for services to replicate.

**中**  
制造业活动更容易实现机械化与化学过程化；再加上制造业生产更容易在空间上集聚，使其能通过规模经济显著提升生产率增长潜力——既包括产出规模带来的“静态规模经济”，也包括“干中学”带来的“动态规模效应”。这些优势很难被服务业复制。

---

**EN**  
Additionally, studies using global input-output data find that manufacturing generates significantly higher productivity spillovers to other sectors than services do. Manufacturing also demonstrates stronger backward and forward linkages — purchasing inputs from and selling outputs to a wider range of sectors — which amplifies its impact on the broader economy.

**中**  
此外，使用全球投入产出数据的研究发现：制造业向其他部门带来的生产率外溢显著高于服务业。制造业还表现出更强的前向与后向关联——从更广泛的部门购买投入、并向更广泛的部门出售产出——从而放大其对整体经济的影响。

---

**EN**  
The innovation dimension is perhaps the most crucial one. Manufacturing firms spend heavily on research and development (R&D), generating strong innovation spillovers throughout the economy. In fact, manufacturing is attributed to 53% of global R&D activity. Manufacturing provides the material foundation for innovation, creates demand for new technologies, and enables the accumulation of productive capabilities that underpin further innovation. While some knowledge-intensive services like software development also drive innovation, the connection between manufacturing and technological progress runs deeper.

**中**  
创新维度也许是最关键的。制造业企业在研发（R&D）上投入巨大，从而在整个经济中产生强烈的创新外溢。事实上，全球 53% 的研发活动可归因于制造业。制造业为创新提供物质基础，创造对新技术的需求，并使得“生产能力”的积累成为可能——而这些能力又会支撑进一步创新。尽管软件开发等部分知识密集型服务也能驱动创新，但制造业与技术进步之间的联系更深。

---

**EN**  
The evidence and arguments I’ve presented so far are captured quite well in the figure below — sourced from UNIDO’s Industrial Development Report 2026 — which shows how manufacturing is strongly connected to innovation, job creation, and economic development.

**中**  
截至目前我所给出的证据与论点，在下图中得到了很好的概括——该图源自 UNIDO 的《工业发展报告 2026》——它展示了制造业如何与创新、就业创造与经济发展紧密相关。

**EN**  
One reason the “services revolution” narrative has gained traction is that trade in services has expanded. Thanks to digitalization and the internet, many services can now be delivered remotely. India’s IT services, the UK’s financial services, and the growth of business process outsourcing all seem to validate services as a new engine of trade-led development.

**中**  
“服务业革命”叙事之所以更受追捧，其中一个原因是服务贸易确实在扩张。得益于数字化与互联网，许多服务现在可以远程交付。印度的 IT 服务、英国的金融服务，以及业务流程外包的增长，看起来都在验证：服务业可以成为一种新的“贸易带动发展”的引擎。

---

**EN**  
But when we examine the evidence carefully, manufacturing remains dominant in international trade — and this matters enormously for economic development. Export of goods (dominated by manufactured goods) accounts for roughly 80% of all global exports. Exports allows countries to specialize, achieve scale, and become competitive, all of which accelerate productivity growth and technological development. Manufacturing has historically been far more tradable than services, and this advantage persists.

**中**  
但如果我们仔细审视证据，会发现制造业仍然主导国际贸易——而这对经济发展至关重要。货物出口（以制造品为主）约占全球出口总额的 80%。出口让国家得以专业化、获得规模、形成竞争力，而这些都会加速生产率增长与技术发展。历史上，制造业一直比服务业更可贸易，而这一优势至今仍然存在。

---

**EN**  
Manufacturing goods are inherently more storable, standardizable, and transportable than most services. Manufacturing also benefits more strongly from “learning by exporting”— firms competing in manufacturing are forced to innovate and improve productivity. A factory can produce for millions of global consumers; most services remain constrained by local demand. For developing countries trying to achieve rapid transformation, accessing global markets through manufacturing exports has proven indispensable.

**中**  
与大多数服务相比，制造品天然更易储存、更标准化、也更便于运输。制造业也更能从“出口学习”（learning by exporting）中获益——参与制造业竞争的企业被迫创新并提升生产率。一家工厂可以面向数百万全球消费者生产；而大多数服务仍受本地需求约束。对试图实现快速转型的发展中国家而言，通过制造业出口进入全球市场已被证明是不可或缺的。

---

**EN**  
Of course, some services that are tradable also enjoy these benefits. However, because a majority of services cannot be traded, the symbiosis between exports and industrialization are stronger. No one has yet found a way to remotely cut someone’s hair, clean someone’s house, serve someone’s food, build someone’s house, or mow someone’s lawn.

**中**  
当然，一些可贸易的服务同样享有这些好处。然而，由于大多数服务并不可贸易，出口与工业化之间的共生关系更强。至今还没有人找到一种方式，能远程给人理发、打扫房子、端盘子、盖房子或修剪草坪。

**EN**  
Perhaps the most common objection to manufacturing-led development today is that automation will eliminate the jobs that made industrialization so powerful for development in the past. If robots can perform the routine tasks that once employed millions in textile factories and assembly lines, won’t automation close off the manufacturing pathway for today’s developing countries?

**中**  
当下对“制造业引领发展”最常见的反对意见之一是：自动化将消灭那些曾经让工业化在发展中如此强大的工作岗位。如果机器人可以完成那些曾在纺织厂与流水线雇佣数百万人的例行任务，那么自动化会不会堵死当今发展中国家的制造业道路？

---

**EN**  
This fear is understandable but overstated. Since the first Industrial Revolution, societies have witnessed continuous workforce disruptions from technological change. The Luddites in 1811 feared automation would destroy textile jobs — and for some artisans it did. But the broader industry saw employment growth because automation increased productivity, lowered prices, and created new jobs.

**中**  
这种担忧可以理解，但被夸大了。自第一次工业革命以来，社会一直在见证技术变革对劳动力的持续冲击。1811 年的卢德分子担心自动化会摧毁纺织业工作——对一些手工业者来说确实如此。但更广泛的产业却出现了就业增长，因为自动化提高了生产率、降低了价格，并创造了新岗位。

---

**EN**  
More recently, automation in manufacturing has generally not led to net job losses. A study of Spanish manufacturing firms from 1990 to 2016 found firms using robots generated employment because output gains outweighed labor intensity reductions. The UN Industrial Development Organization calculated that the growth in industrial robot stock had a positive effect on global employment from 2000 to 2014.

**中**  
更近期的经验表明：制造业自动化通常并未导致净就业减少。一项覆盖 1990—2016 年西班牙制造业企业的研究发现：使用机器人的企业反而创造了就业，因为产出增加带来的效应超过了“劳动密集度下降”的影响。联合国工业发展组织也计算得出：2000—2014 年间，工业机器人存量的增长对全球就业具有正向影响。

---

**EN**  
For developing countries, multiple barriers limit automation’s impact. Most automation technologies are developed for high-wage contexts and only become economically viable when labor costs are high. In labor-intensive industries like textiles and food processing, automation often cannot compete with low-cost labor. A report by the UN Conference for Trade and Development notes that “what is technically feasible is not always economically profitable.”

**中**  
对发展中国家而言，多重障碍会限制自动化的影响。大多数自动化技术是在高工资环境下发展出来的，只有当劳动力成本高时才更具有经济可行性。在纺织、食品加工等劳动密集型行业，自动化往往无法与低成本劳动力竞争。联合国贸发会议的一份报告指出：“技术上可行的，并不总是经济上有利可图的。”

---

**EN**  
The most sophisticated forecast studies predict workforce reorganization rather than mass unemployment. McKinsey estimates that 3-14% of the global workforce will need to switch occupational categories by 2030 — consistent with historical workforce reorganizations, not an unprecedented crisis. Automation may transform manufacturing, but it won’t eliminate manufacturing’s role in economic development.

**中**  
更严谨的预测研究倾向于认为：未来会发生劳动力的重新组织，而不是大规模失业。麦肯锡估计，到 2030 年全球劳动力中有 3%—14% 需要转换职业类别——这与历史上的劳动力重组一致，并非前所未有的危机。自动化也许会改变制造业，但不会消除制造业在经济发展中的作用。

---

**EN**  
China’s labour-intensive industrialization in particular challenges the idea that automation inevitably displaces workers. Labour absorption in China’s manufacturing ecosystem has remained strong alongside the rapid adoption of industrial robots. China’s manufacturing ecosystem currently employs roughly 200 million workers — more than a quarter of the national workforce — demonstrating an exceptional capacity for labour absorption (estimates vary depending on how one defines the manufacturing ecosystem).

**中**  
中国的劳动密集型工业化尤其挑战了“自动化必然挤出工人”的观点。在快速采用工业机器人的同时，中国制造业生态系统的劳动力吸纳能力依然很强。中国的制造业生态系统目前大约雇佣 2 亿工人——超过全国劳动力的四分之一——展现出异常强的就业吸纳能力（具体估计会因“制造业生态系统”的定义不同而有所差异）。

---

**EN**  
This strong labour retainment in manufacturing (China’s peak was reached in the early 2010s) has occurred in parallel with one of the highest growth rates of industrial robot adoption in the world. China’s installed stock of industrial robots grew ten-fold from 2014 to 2024 — from approximately 200,000 to 2,000,0000. China’s stock of industrial robots is currently the highest in the world, dwarfing all other countries.

**中**  
制造业中这种强劲的劳动力留存（中国的峰值在 2010 年代初达到）与全球最高增速之一的工业机器人采用同步发生。2014—2024 年，中国工业机器人装机存量增长了十倍——从约 20 万台增长到约 2,000,0000（原文此处数字书写如此）。中国目前的工业机器人存量为全球最高，远超其他国家。

**EN**  
While automation has undoubtedly displaced some workers within China’s manufacturing sector — and employment in China’s manufacturing ecosystem has slightly declined from its peak in the early 2010s — the overall evidence shows that large-scale labour absorption in manufacturing can coexist with, and even accompany, the diffusion of advanced industrial automation technologies.

**中**  
尽管自动化无疑在中国制造业内部替代了部分工人——而且中国制造业生态系统的就业人数也确实从 2010 年代初的峰值略有下降——但总体证据表明：制造业的大规模劳动力吸纳可以与先进工业自动化技术的扩散共存，甚至能够伴随其发生。

---

**EN**  
China’s manufacturing dominance raises an obvious concern. If China’s share of global manufacturing, which now stands at 35%, keeps growing, doesn’t this necessarily crowd out industrialization opportunities for other developing countries?

**中**  
中国制造业的主导地位引发了一个显而易见的担忧：如果中国在全球制造业中的份额（目前约为 35%）继续增长，难道不会必然挤出其他发展中国家的工业化机会吗？

---

**EN**  
The claim that China’s manufacturing dominance is preventing industrialization elsewhere overlooks a crucial fact: very few countries managed to industrialize successfully even before China’s manufacturing boom. Most countries that struggled to develop manufacturing capabilities in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s — long before China became the world’s factory — continue to struggle today. China didn’t create the barriers to industrialization that most developing countries face.

**中**  
“由于中国制造业主导，其他地方无法工业化”的说法忽略了一个关键事实：即使在中国制造业大爆发之前，也几乎没有多少国家成功实现工业化。那些在 1960、1970、1980 年代——远在中国成为“世界工厂”之前——就难以发展制造业能力的国家，今天仍然在挣扎。中国并没有制造出大多数发展中国家所面临的工业化障碍。

---

**EN**  
More tellingly, Vietnam, the country with the most impressive growth of manufactured exports per capita, is heavily integrated into China’s manufacturing ecosystem. Vietnam’s industrialization success contradicts the crowding-out hypothesis. Rather than being blocked by Chinese competition, Vietnam has leveraged its connections to Chinese supply chains, technology, and investment to rapidly build competitive manufacturing capabilities. This suggests that proximity to China’s industrial base can enable rather than prevent industrialization when countries pursue the right strategies.

**中**  
更能说明问题的是：越南——人均制造品出口增长最亮眼的国家——与中国制造业生态高度融合。越南的工业化成功与“挤出假说”相矛盾。越南并未被中国竞争所阻断，反而利用与中国供应链、技术与投资的连接，迅速建立起有竞争力的制造业能力。这表明：当国家采取正确策略时，靠近中国的产业基础可能促进而不是阻止工业化。

---

**EN**  
China’s rise does present real challenges — simple math dictates that as one country captures more of the global manufacturing pie, less manufacturing occurs elsewhere. But when we see China partnering with developing countries to enable infrastructure development, energy sovereignty, and manufacturing opportunities, there’s clear evidence that China’s industrial ascent creates also create possibilities for structural transformation.

**中**  
中国的崛起确实带来真实挑战——简单算术决定：当一个国家拿走更多全球制造业“蛋糕”，其他地方的制造业就会更少。但当我们看到中国与发展中国家合作，推动基础设施建设、能源自主与制造业机会时，也有清晰证据表明：中国的工业崛起同样会为结构性转型创造新的可能。

**EN**  
A recent book investigating China’s rise in Africa highlights that China provides real industrialization opportunities for the continent. It highlights two channels through which China contributes to industrialization in Africa: (a) infrastructure finance and construction, and (b) direct investment in manufacturing. The book, however, does emphasise that outcomes are uneven and highly dependent on national policy and agency. African governments, firms, and workers negotiate, contest, and shape these outcomes. In particular, the state’s ability to discipline capital and proactively steer industrial policy is crucial.

**中**  
一本近期研究“中国在非洲崛起”的书指出：中国为非洲大陆提供了真实的工业化机会。书中强调了中国促进非洲工业化的两条渠道：（a）基础设施融资与建设；（b）对制造业的直接投资。不过，该书也强调：结果并不均衡，且高度依赖各国自身的政策与能动性。非洲的政府、企业与劳动者会谈判、博弈并塑造这些结果。尤其重要的是：国家能否约束资本并主动引导产业政策。

**EN**  
Most successful development stories — from Britain’s Industrial Revolution to South Korea’s transformation to China’s ascent — have run through the factory floor. Manufacturing drives productivity through economies of scale that services struggle to replicate. It generates innovation spillovers that ripple through entire economies. It enables countries to access global markets at a scale services cannot match. And contrary to fears about automation eliminating manufacturing jobs, countries like China demonstrate that manufacturing can absorb hundreds of millions of workers even as robots proliferate.

**中**  
大多数成功的发展故事——从英国的工业革命，到韩国的转型，再到中国的崛起——都发生在工厂车间之上。制造业通过服务业难以复制的规模经济推动生产率；它产生创新外溢并在全经济范围内扩散；它让国家以服务业难以匹敌的规模进入全球市场。并且，与“自动化会消灭制造业岗位”的担忧相反，中国等国家表明：即便机器人普及，制造业仍能吸纳数以亿计的劳动力。

---

**EN**  
Services are of course not unimportant. Digital platforms, financial services, and business process outsourcing create real opportunities for development. But they cannot replace manufacturing’s role as the engine of sustained productivity growth and structural transformation. Countries that have neglected industrialization — or lost it prematurely — have paid the price in terms of slower growth, persistent trade deficits, and diminished innovation capacity.

**中**  
服务业当然并非不重要。数字平台、金融服务、业务流程外包确实带来真实的发展机会。但它们无法取代制造业作为“持续生产率增长与结构性转型引擎”的角色。那些忽视工业化——或过早失去工业化能力——的国家，已经在增长放缓、长期贸易逆差与创新能力下降方面付出了代价。

**EN**  
The factory of the future will look different from the factories of the past. But manufacturing — transforming raw materials into finished products — will remain central to development. The path to prosperity still runs through making things.

**中**  
未来的工厂会与过去的工厂截然不同。但制造业——把原材料转化为制成品——仍将是发展的核心。通往繁荣的道路，仍然要靠“做东西”。
